This library provides parser and evaluator for Common Expression Language (CEL) expressions in Python projects. CEL is a language developed by Google that allows for safe and fast evaluation of expressions in a wide variety of applications, such as policy engines, rule engines, and more.


* Documentation: https://cel-in-py.readthedocs.io.


Features
--------

- Parse and evaluate CEL expressions directly within TypeScript projects.
- Support for common arithmetic operations, logical operations, and comparisons.
- Extensible design for adding custom functions and variables.
- Error handling during parsing with custom error listeners.
- Context-based evaluation to support dynamic expression evaluation.
